# Assignment 1
#### By Peyton Freedland
Performs double precision arithmetic, computes absolute and relative error, and performs bisection and newton-Raphson methods among other functions.

## Technologies Used
- GitHub
- Python

## Description
Converts binary string to decimal number with double precision, then chops and rounds the result to 3 decimal places. Computes absolute and relative error between exact and rounded values. Computes a value of an infinite series with small error. Determines number of iterations needed to solve a polynomial function with small error using the bisection and newton-Raphson methods.

## Installation
- Create a file named `requirements.txt`: type `pip freeze > requirements.txt` into terminal.

- Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install NumPy
```bash
pip install numpy
```

- In command line, type `python assignment_1.py`, then either press `ENTER/RETURN` or click the `RUN` button (â–·) to run program.

  - To save output to file, type `python [INSERT DIRECTORIES HERE]/assignment_1.py > "answers.txt"`

- After running program, type `diff [INSERT DIRECTORIES HERE]/src/main/answers.txt [INSERT DIRECTORIES HERE]/src/main/answers-5.txt` to compare output to downloaded file.
